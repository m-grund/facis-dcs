# Digital Contracting Service (DCS)
The **Digital Contracting Service** provides an **open-source platform** for creating, signing, and managing contracts digitally.  
Integrated with the **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI)**, it guarantees that all digital transactions are secure, legally binding, and interoperable.  
DCS allows organizations to streamline business processes, reduce paperwork, and ensure **compliance with eIDAS 2.0 regulations**, while fostering trust across federated partners.

**The detailed specifications for the Digital Contracting Service (DCS) can be found: [SRS_FACIS_DCS](https://github.com/eclipse-xfsc/facis/tree/main/DCS/specification/SRS_FACIS_DCS.pdf).**

## DCS Backend

## Development Quick Start (Rancher Desktop + Helm)
This repository uses Helm-managed dependencies in Kubernetes for local development.

1. Start Rancher Desktop with Kubernetes enabled.
2. From project root, run:

```bash
bash dev-stack.sh
```

This sets up Helm dependencies, prepares backend env and C2PA cert-chain, then starts frontend (Vite) and backend (air).

For step-by-step manual commands and troubleshooting, see [deployment/README.md](./deployment/README.md#local-development).
