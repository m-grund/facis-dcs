## 1. Purpose and Context

The Digital Contracting Service (DCS) is a Go backend that manages the full lifecycle of digital contracts in a Gaia-X / Federated Catalogue context: from template creation through negotiation, review, and approval to digital signing and a tamper-evident audit trail. A central characteristic is **federation between multiple DCS instances** run by different operators, which must keep shared contracts in sync without implicitly trusting one another.

This document describes the architecture as it emerges from the codebase — as a reference for onboarding, architectural decisions, and client communication.

**Key observation:** This is a **modular monolith**, not microservices — all domains run in the same process and share a single PostgreSQL instance, but are decoupled through clear module boundaries and an internal event bus (NATS). See [ADR-0001](decisions/0001-cqrs-per-domain.md).

## 5. Domain Overview

The domain split is a **business-driven** decomposition (bounded contexts), not a purely technical one. Not every domain needs the full CQRS pattern — the split follows actual need:

| Domain | Command | Query | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contractworkflowengine` | ✅ (13) | ✅ (9) | Core domain: contract lifecycle, negotiation, approval |
| `templaterepository` | ✅ (10) | ✅ (7) | Template lifecycle, versioning, catalogue publishing |
| `templatecatalogueintegration` | ✅ (8) | ✅ (12) | Integration with the Gaia-X Federated Catalogue |
| `signingmanagement` | ✅ (4) | ✅ (5) | Digital signing (DSS integration) |
| `pdfgeneration` | – | ✅ (5) | Purely event-driven (C2PA/provenance), no user commands |
| `processauditandcompliance` | – | ✅ (7) | Read-only access to the cross-domain audit trail |
| `dcstodcs` | – | – | Orchestration; the actual commands live in `contractworkflowengine/remotesync` |
| `auth`, `webhookplatform`, `semantic`, `cryptoprovider`, `base`, `middleware` | – | – | Infrastructure, adapters, or stateless utilities — no business aggregate |

**Why some domains have no CQRS split:** `pdfgeneration` and `processauditandcompliance` are either purely event-driven (no direct user command) or purely read-only. `service/` is deliberately the thin translation layer between Goa and the domain handlers and contains no business logic of its own. `dcstodcs` only orchestrates — the actual state-mutating commands executed during sync deliberately live in the domain the data belongs to (`contractworkflowengine/remotesync/command`), not in the sync infrastructure domain.

---

## 6. The CQRS Pattern in Detail

Every command handler follows the exact same flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant Svc as service/*.go (adapter)
    participant H as command.<Verb>er
    participant Repo as db.<Domain>Repo
    participant Ev as base/event

    C->>Svc: HTTP request (Goa)
    Svc->>Svc: Map transport DTO → Cmd struct
    Svc->>H: Handle(ctx, cmd)
    H->>H: BeginTx
    H->>Repo: ReadProcessDataByDID (current state)
    H->>H: Authorization / state validation
    H->>Repo: Mutation (UpdateState / Create / ...)
    H->>Ev: event.Create(ctx, tx, evt, component)
    Note over Ev: Event lands in the outbox table<br/>within the same transaction
    H->>H: Commit
    H-->>Svc: Result / error
    Svc-->>C: Goa response
```

The command handler bundles only the repository dependencies that *this specific* use case needs (dependency injection at the handler level, not the service level) — e.g. `command.Approver` carries exactly `CRepo`, `ATRepo`, `SRepo`, `DIDDocument`.

---

## 7. Event Sourcing & Tamper-Evident Audit Trail

Every write **and** read operation produces a domain event, which is carried through a transactional outbox pattern into an immutable, externally anchored audit trail. See [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-event-sourced-audit-trail.md).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Handler as Command/Query Handler
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (outbox_events)
    participant OP as OutboxProcessor (background job)
    participant TSA as TSA client
    participant IPFS as IPFS
    participant NATS as NATS (CloudEvents)

    Handler->>DB: INSERT event (same transaction as the business change)
    Note over OP: Polling, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    OP->>DB: SELECT unprocessed events
    OP->>DB: Read predecessor CID (per resource + global)
    OP->>TSA: Timestamp(auditLogEntry)
    TSA-->>OP: signed timestamp
    OP->>OP: Verify(tsaResult) – sanity check
    OP->>IPFS: CreateFile(signedAuditLogEntry)
    IPFS-->>OP: new CID
    OP->>DB: UpdateLogCID (resource + global), mark event processed
    OP->>NATS: Publish(CloudEvent)
```

Every audit entry references both the **previous CID of the same resource** and the **previous global CID** — a hash chain similar to a blockchain, combined with a trusted timestamp. This makes retroactive tampering with the audit trail detectable.

## 8. Contract Workflow Engine: State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> DRAFT: Create
    DRAFT --> NEGOTIATION: Submit
    REJECTED --> NEGOTIATION: Submit (tasks reopened)
    NEGOTIATION --> NEGOTIATION: Submit (new version after merge)
    NEGOTIATION --> SUBMITTED: Submit (all negotiations accepted)
    SUBMITTED --> REVIEWED: Submit + ActionFlag=APPROVAL (all reviewers done)
    SUBMITTED --> NEGOTIATION: Submit + ActionFlag=REJECT
    REVIEWED --> APPROVED: Approve (all approvers done)
    REVIEWED --> REJECTED: Reject
    REVIEWED --> SUBMITTED: Submit (re-review)
    APPROVED --> TERMINATED: Terminate
    NEGOTIATION --> TERMINATED: Terminate
    SUBMITTED --> TERMINATED: Terminate
    REVIEWED --> TERMINATED: Terminate
    DRAFT --> TERMINATED: Terminate
    [*] --> EXPIRED: Cron (exp_date reached)
```

**Key principles:**

- **Fan-out/fan-in over tasks:** A contract state transition (`REVIEWED → APPROVED`) only fires once *all* associated tasks (review/approval/negotiation, one per responsible peer) are closed.
- **`Submit` is the central, overloaded transition** — its behavior depends entirely on the current state (state pattern via `if/else`, not polymorphism).
- **Immediately consistent expiry detection:** the DB view `contracts_effective` computes `EXPIRED` at read time as soon as `exp_date` has passed — independent of the asynchronously lagging cron job that writes the physical state value and emits the corresponding event.
- **Task ownership is peer-scoped, not user-scoped:** `Approvers`/`Reviewers`/`Negotiators` in `Responsible` are peer DIDs (other DCS instances), not individual people. Individual roles (`ContractApprover`, etc.) are additionally checked purely locally via RBAC.

### Negotiation Merging

Once the last open negotiation task is closed, `MergeChangeRequests` folds all **accepted** change requests of the current version together:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Load all accepted<br/>change requests"] --> B["Apply field by field<br/>(name, description, dates, expiry policy)"]
    B --> C["Upsert SemanticConditionValues<br/>by (BlockID, ParameterName, ConditionID)"]
    C --> D["Contract version + 1<br/>Previous state → contract_history"]
```

Conflict strategy: **last-write-wins** in persistence order — there is no explicit conflict detection between contradictory change requests from multiple negotiators.

---

## 9. Template Repository: State Machine & Versioning

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> DRAFT: Create
    DRAFT --> SUBMITTED: Submit
    REJECTED --> SUBMITTED: Submit (reopen)
    SUBMITTED --> REVIEWED: Submit (all reviewers approved)
    SUBMITTED --> REJECTED: Submit (one reviewer rejected)
    REVIEWED --> APPROVED: Approve
    REVIEWED --> REJECTED: Reject
    REVIEWED --> SUBMITTED: Submit (reopen)
    APPROVED --> REGISTERED: Register
    REGISTERED --> PUBLISHED: Publish
```

### Versioning Strategy: Copy-on-Version

Unlike contracts, there is **no mutable "current row"** — every template version is its own row with its own DID. See [ADR-0006](decisions/0006-versioning-strategies.md).

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Lineage["One lineage (base_template = A)"]
        A["DID A<br/>version=1<br/>REGISTERED"]
        B["DID B<br/>version=2<br/>base_template=A<br/>PUBLISHED"]
        C["DID C<br/>version=3<br/>base_template=A<br/>DRAFT (in progress)"]
    end
    A -- "Copy (source REGISTERED/PUBLISHED)<br/>→ version+1, same lineage" --> B
    B -- "Copy" --> C
```

The `Copy` command performs two different roles depending on the state of the source:
- Source **not yet** registered/published → the copy starts a **new, independent lineage** (`base_template` = its own new DID, `version = 1`)
- Source **already** registered/published → the copy inherits the source's `base_template`, `version + 1`

A SQL guard prevents competing version numbers within the same lineage. Which version is "the current one" is computed **at read time** via a window function (`outdated` flag, `latest_did` pointer), not persisted.

### Comparison: Template vs. Contract Versioning

| | Templates | Contracts |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Copy-on-version: new DID per version | In-place: one DID, version counter |
| Chaining | `base_template` foreign key | Not needed (DID stays stable) |
| History | Every version is its own row | Separate `contract_history` table (append-only snapshots) |
| Trigger | Explicit `Copy` call (user action) | Implicit trigger via negotiation merge |

---

## 10. DCS-to-DCS Synchronization

DCS instances run by different operators synchronize shared contracts through a **single-writer-per-aggregate** model. See [ADR-0004](decisions/0004-did-web-eidas-trust.md) and [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-single-writer-peer-sync.md).

### Trust Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Slave as Peer B (not origin)
    participant Master as Peer A (origin)

    Slave->>Slave: rand.Text() → secretValue
    Slave->>Slave: DIDDocument.Sign(secretValue) → secretHash
    Slave->>Master: Action/PostSync request<br/>(secretValue, secretHash, FromPeerDID)
    Master->>Master: FetchDIDDocumentFromHostname(FromPeerDID)<br/>via /.well-known/did.json
    Master->>Master: VerifyEIDASCertificate(against EU trust pool)
    Master->>Master: Verify(secretValue, secretHash)
    Master->>Master: IsTrustedPeer(FromPeerDID) – local allowlist
    alt all checks pass
        Master-->>Slave: 200 OK
    else
        Master-->>Slave: 400/500 error
    end
```

Trust rests on three independent layers: an **eIDAS certificate chain** (regulatory anchor, EU trusted lists), a **challenge-response signature** (proof of possession of the private `did:web` key per request), and a **local trusted-peer allowlist** (explicit acceptance by the operator).

### Single-Writer-per-Aggregate ("Master-Slave per Contract")

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User at Peer B
    participant PeerB as Peer B (slave for this contract)
    participant PeerA as Peer A (origin/master)
    participant Bus as NATS event bus (at Peer A)

    User->>PeerB: Approve(contractDID, updatedAt, ...)
    PeerB->>PeerB: Origin != localPeer? → forward
    PeerB->>PeerA: Action RPC (same command, signed)
    PeerA->>PeerA: IsValidApprover(CauserDID) – peer-scoped task ownership
    PeerA->>PeerA: cmd.UpdatedAt vs. stored UpdatedAt (optimistic concurrency)
    PeerA->>PeerA: State mutation + commit
    PeerA->>Bus: Domain event (ApproveEvent)
    Bus->>PeerA: Trigger doContractPeerSync
    PeerA->>PeerB: PostSync (full state snapshot, all tasks of all peers)
    PeerB->>PeerB: LocalPeerUpdater: upsert all data
```

**Key properties:**

- The "master" (`Origin`) is fixed **per contract**, not globally — a node can be master for its own contracts and slave for others.
- Task ownership (who may change an approval/review/negotiation task) is **peer-scoped**: the requesting peer DID (`CauserDID`) is checked against the peer DID stored on the task — not the individual end user.
- All peers hold a **full copy** of every task belonging to every other peer (full replication via `PostSync`), but only the assigned peer may change its own task.
- Optimistic concurrency control via a client-supplied `updated_at` timestamp (see [ADR-0007](decisions/0007-optimistic-concurrency-timestamp.md)) prevents overwriting a state that has changed in the meantime.
- Failed syncs land in a retry queue (`sync_fails`) and are retried by a periodic scheduler.
