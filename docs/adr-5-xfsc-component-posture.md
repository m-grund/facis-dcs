# ADR-5: XFSC component posture — what is retained, what is substituted

## Status

Accepted. Revised 2026-07-29 to record the retained Status List Service's
binary compatibility model, durable contract-status publication and
fail-closed trust defaults. The 2026-07-28 revision recorded the retained
Federated Catalogue's supported graph-store and deployment lifecycle and
ORCE's role as the reference PAC audit executor.

## Context

DCS is built against the XFSC (GAIA-X Federated Secure Computing) stack.
Appendix D describes the OCM W-Stack deployment, whose "essential crypto
parts are defined in the Crypto Provider Service (formerly TSA Signer
Service)." Appendix E describes the Status List Service, deployable
standalone or together with the Crypto Provider Service. IR-SI-02 requires
Node-RED-webhook-compatible orchestration integration. Not every XFSC
component fits DCS's actual key-custody decision (ADR-1), and this ADR
records, component by component, which are used as specified and which are
substituted.

## Decision

| XFSC component | Posture |
|---|---|
| Federated Catalogue | Retained. DCS integrates with its asset, schema, query and verification interfaces (`backend/internal/templatecatalogueintegration/client/client.go:100-105`, `backend/internal/templatecatalogueintegration/client/client.go:108-183`). The supported co-deployment uses Fuseki as its graph store; Neo4j/n10s is no longer a runtime dependency (`deployment/helm/charts/federated-catalogue/templates/deployment.yaml:41-53`). |
| XFSC Status List Service | Retained. Credential checks consume signed XFSC status lists and the supported W3C Bitstring Status List form; contract suspension and termination are durably published to XFSC. XFSC's single bit is interpreted as `active` when clear and `revoked` when set; a requested suspension is therefore represented by the same set bit and rejected fail-closed rather than reported as a distinct XFSC state (`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/handler/xfsc.go:107-121`, `backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/policy.go:75-99`, `backend/internal/signingmanagement/command/revoke.go:89-97`). |
| ORCE (orchestration engine) | Retained. IR-SI-02's Node-RED-webhook compatibility is satisfied by the shipped flows. In addition to contract-target orchestration, ORCE provides this environment's reference implementation of the versioned PAC audit-executor contract (`deployment/helm/charts/orce/flows/audit-executor-flow.json:1-94`). |
| Crypto Provider Service (Appendix D's "essential crypto parts") | **Substituted** by PKCS#11/HSM key custody (ADR-1). IR-HI-01's "standardized interfaces" wording is read as satisfied by PKCS#11 itself being the standardized interface — DCS does not require the specific Crypto Provider Service REST API to satisfy that requirement, since PKCS#11 already is one. |
| IPFS Document Manager (`ipfs-document-manager` + `ssi-vdr-ipfs`) | **Removed** (ADR-36). The wrapper answered every read by listing the whole pinset under Kubo's pinner read lock, and gave an add and its pin one shared 5s deadline — so a store failed reporting `failed to pin` when the add had spent the budget. Both are literals in the plugin with no deployment-side override. Artifacts are stored through the Kubo RPC API directly; the node, the CIDs and the artifacts are unchanged. |
| OCM W-Stack (issuance/verification/retrieval/well-known) | Not used for VC signing — see [adr-ocmw-vc-signing.md](adr-ocmw-vc-signing.md) for the detailed evaluation of why the OCM-W protocol (OID4VCI wallet-pull) does not fit DCS's synchronous in-process signing requirement. Remains the natural integration point if DCS later issues credentials *to* wallet holders (a different feature than what it does today). |

### Federated Catalogue deployment lifecycle

The retained catalogue is deployed from the DCS Helm chart with Fuseki,
PostgreSQL and Keycloak. Fuseki was selected over the earlier Neo4j/n10s
combination because FC startup invoked `n10s.graphconfig.show`, while the n10s
plugin was incompatible with the drifting Neo4j patch image. The result was a
terminal crash loop that could never become ready. The current chart selects
`GRAPHSTORE_IMPL=fuseki`, points FC at the Fuseki dataset and disables the
irrelevant Spring Neo4j health indicator
(`deployment/helm/charts/federated-catalogue/templates/deployment.yaml:41-53`).
The Fuseki image is pinned to the FC revision used by the service
(`deployment/helm/charts/fuseki/values.yaml:1-13`).

Readiness is a lifecycle, not a fixed delay:

1. Keycloak reports its native OIDC discovery endpoint ready
   (`deployment/helm/charts/keycloak/templates/deployment.yaml:114-122`).
2. Realm provisioning waits on the native Deployment condition and runs once,
   with no Job retry (`deployment/helm/templates/fc-realm-provision-job.yaml:41-70`).
3. The backend observes both terminal Job conditions. `Complete` permits
   startup; `Failed` returns the Kubernetes reason and fails the init container
   (`deployment/helm/templates/deployment.yaml:69-123`).
4. FC's own readiness probe uses `/actuator/health`
   (`deployment/helm/charts/federated-catalogue/templates/deployment.yaml:124-134`).
5. DCS performs one semantic `/verification` call and one schema
   synchronization before exposing `/readyz` as ready
   (`backend/internal/templatecatalogueintegration/client/client.go:108-183`,
   `backend/cmd/dcs/main.go:509-547`,
   `backend/cmd/dcs/readiness.go:19-28`).

This sequence deliberately contains no FC warm-up request, schema-sync retry or
blanket readiness sleep. A terminal response is returned immediately to the
deployment entry point, which prints the relevant Deployment, Job, Pod and log
diagnostics (`deployment/helm/deploy.sh:90-101`,
`deployment/helm/deploy.sh:119-147`).

### ORCE-backed PAC audit execution

`POST /pac/audit` remains the authenticated DCS boundary. DCS authorizes the
request, validates its scope and gathers the applicable template, contract,
signature or archive evidence before making one HTTP request to the configured
executor (`backend/internal/service/process_audit_and_compliance.go:66-110`,
`backend/internal/service/process_audit_and_compliance.go:355-405`). For
signature audits, the evidence is a safe metadata projection; raw signature
bytes and the JAdES token are deliberately excluded
(`backend/internal/service/signature_audit_evidence.go:13-31`,
`backend/internal/service/signature_audit_evidence.go:70-93`).

The integration contract is `facis-pac-audit-executor/v1`. It correlates the
audit and request, identifies scope and optional resource, carries requester,
justification and DCS-procured evidence, and returns executor identity,
execution time, findings and an optional receipt
(`backend/internal/processauditandcompliance/auditexecutor/client.go:17-65`).
The DCS performs exactly one bounded dispatch. It does not retry, substitute
local findings or fall back to another executor. Non-2xx responses, timeouts,
oversized or malformed JSON, unknown fields and mismatched correlation,
version, scope, resource or finding result fail closed
(`backend/internal/processauditandcompliance/auditexecutor/client.go:92-138`,
`backend/internal/processauditandcompliance/auditexecutor/client.go:152-187`).

The shipped ORCE flow exposes `/audit/run` as the reference implementation for
this environment and produces the final PAC findings from the supplied
evidence. Specialized DCS validators may contribute technical check evidence,
but ORCE does not duplicate DCS-local SHACL execution
(`deployment/helm/charts/orce/flows/audit-executor-flow.json:1-53`). A customer
may replace ORCE with any endpoint implementing the same versioned contract by
setting the Helm executor URL. URL, path, timeout and an optional bearer token
from a Secret are deployment configuration; no DCS code change is required
(`deployment/helm/values.yaml:108-124`,
`deployment/helm/templates/deployment.yaml:345-363`). The BDD profile proves
this replacement boundary by selecting the compatible
`/customer-audit/run` endpoint (`deployment/helm/values.bdd.yml:422-424`).

Only a validated successful response is persisted. `pac_audit_runs` is
append-only and keeps both queryable JSONB and the exact response bytes,
together with request/response hashes and executor provenance
(`backend/migrations/sql/20260728b_pac_audit_runs.sql:1-36`). The run and its
`PAC_AUDIT_EXECUTED` outbox event are committed in the same database
transaction (`backend/internal/service/pac_audit_run.go:48-82`). Reports never
execute the checks again: JSON returns the exact stored response bytes, while
CSV and PDF are projections of that same run
(`backend/internal/service/audit_report.go:107-127`,
`backend/internal/service/process_audit_and_compliance.go:449-503`). The exact
emitted report bytes are hashed, stored in IPFS when configured, and recorded
with scope, format, CID, justification and summary in
`PAC_REPORT_GENERATED`
(`backend/internal/service/process_audit_and_compliance.go:481-500`,
`backend/internal/service/process_audit_and_compliance.go:520-563`).

### Status-list compatibility and publication

The credential-verification boundary is strict. Missing status references,
unavailable lists, unknown mechanisms, malformed encodings and untrusted or
invalid list signatures do not authorize the holder. W3C Bitstring Status
Lists preserve their declared revocation or suspension purpose, while both
states are rejection outcomes (`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/verifier.go:34-79`,
`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/policy.go:65-106`,
`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/handler/w3c_bitstring.go:30-82`).
Unsigned XFSC fallback exists only as an explicit environment option; with the
option disabled, retrieval or signature failure is terminal
(`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/status/handler/xfsc.go:19-78`).

Contract termination and signature revocation enqueue the desired lifecycle
status in the same database transaction as the state change and audit event
(`backend/internal/contractworkflowengine/command/terminate.go:84-107`,
`backend/internal/signingmanagement/command/revoke.go:58-97`). The queue key is
`(contract_did, status)`, so repeated requests for the same desired state are
idempotent. A database-backed worker claims pending entries without competing
workers duplicating the same attempt, records failures and retries with bounded
backoff (`backend/migrations/sql/20260729a_poa_sync_and_status_publication.sql:7-26`,
`backend/internal/pdfgeneration/statuspublication/queue.go:24-36`,
`backend/internal/pdfgeneration/statuspublication/queue.go:52-150`).

The production chart deliberately supplies neither the development issuer
registry nor the Dev Root. An x5c-bearing credential without configured trust
anchors is refused. The development trust files and unsigned XFSC fallback are
enabled only by the BDD/BDD2 overlays
(`deployment/helm/values.yaml:62-85`,
`deployment/helm/values.bdd.yml:73-80`,
`deployment/helm/values.bdd2.yml:59-64`,
`backend/internal/auth/oid4vp/sdjwt/keys.go:133-167`). The concrete production
issuer/root profile is operator configuration and is not selected by this ADR.

## Consequences

- The substitution is documented rather than silently made, so a reviewer
  checking Appendix D compliance finds the reasoning here instead of
  discovering an unexplained gap.
- The swap-back path (re-adopting the Crypto Provider Service instead of
  PKCS#11 directly) stays open: DCS's signer interfaces (`VCSigner`,
  the HSM `crypto.Signer`) are narrow enough that a Crypto-Provider-backed
  implementation could be substituted without touching call sites.
- XFSC compatibility does not invent a third binary value for suspension.
  Suspension and revocation both set the blocking bit; the contract lifecycle
  banner remains separately available to explain whether the business state is
  suspended or terminated.
- A transient status-service failure remains visible and retryable. It never
  turns into an `active` authorization or verification result.
- A development installation that still contains the obsolete Neo4j/n10s
  catalogue is replaced by the current Fuseki-based chart; catalogue data from
  the unreleased development stack is not migrated. This is explicitly covered
  by the lifecycle acceptance scenario
  (`features/25_federated_catalogue_deployment_lifecycle/federated_catalogue_deployment_lifecycle.feature:45-52`).
- Reproducibility depends on the committed Helm dependency lock and immutable
  FC workload images. The deployment path rebuilds dependencies from
  `Chart.lock` without refreshing it (`deployment/helm/deploy.sh:103-107`), and
  the lifecycle contract verifies deterministic rendering plus digest-pinned FC
  images (`deployment/helm/tests/federated_catalogue_lifecycle_test.sh:16-29`,
  `deployment/helm/tests/federated_catalogue_lifecycle_test.sh:59-87`).
- ORCE is the reference executor shipped with this environment, not a
  hard-coded compliance authority. Operators retain the responsibility for
  the rules and compatible executor used in their deployment.
- Executor unavailability cannot silently turn into locally synthesized
  findings. A failed dispatch produces no successful persisted run; an
  operator must correct the executor or explicitly initiate another audit.
- The executor's returned bytes are durable evidence. Append-only persistence,
  response hashes and report generation from those stored bytes make the
  executor result and every exported representation independently traceable.
