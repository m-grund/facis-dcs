# Idempotently issue a dev-CA leaf certificate whose public key is the SoftHSM
# token's dcs-c2pa key, and write the leaf+CA chain as the C2PA COSE x5chain
# (RFC 9360) that pdf-core embeds. pdf-core signs COSE Sig_structure bytes via
# the backend's PKCS#11 dcs-c2pa key (DCS-IR-HI-01); the x5chain must therefore
# carry that key's public half so a verifier can check the ES256 signature.
#
# The dev CA (out-dir/c2pa-ca.key + c2pa-ca.crt) is generated once and reused so
# it stays a stable trust anchor across runs; the leaf is re-issued every run so
# it always matches the current token key (surviving key rotation).
#
# The same chain publishes the key that signs this deployment's status list
# (ADR-34). A verifier holds a status list to the same binding as a credential —
# the leaf must NAME the issuer the token claims to come from — so the leaf
# carries the identifiers this deployment answers to as subjectAltName entries.
# Without them a correctly-signed list is refused as coming from an unidentified
# issuer, which reads to a caller exactly like a revoked contract.
#
# Usage: c2pa-cert-provision.sh <token-dir> <token-label> <pin> <x5chain-out> [module-path] [crl-url] [issuer-url] [issuer-did]
