/**
 * The normative two-instance negotiation vertical: instance A (originator) and
 * instance B (counterparty) drive a contract from its own authored vocabulary
 * and template — SHACL shape, component with a semantic clause, composed
 * contract template published to the Federated Catalogue — all the way through
 * proposal, a non-trivial negotiation ping-pong, mutual signature, deployment
 * and audit, with every exported artifact independently verified (PDF/A-3a via
 * veraPDF + a valid, GROWING C2PA chain via c2patool) on BOTH parties at every
 * hop. No seeded fixtures: A authors the whole contract through the real UI
 * before offering it to B.
 *
 * Exercises the merged backend R5/R5c work: the negotiation counter-offer
 * round-trip (each adjustment ships a new PDF, chain grows), the
 * settle/consolidation gate (signing refused pre-settle; extrinsic phase
 * proposed→agreed→executed on the retrieve API), and cross-instance double
 * signing (B signs on A's signed PDF). The single-instance full-vertical.spec.ts
 * stays as the local-only lifecycle coverage until this supersedes it.
 *
 * SRS traceability: every stage cites the governing requirement so this reads as
 * a normative, traceable proof rather than an arbitrary script. Federation is
 * governed by ADR-13 (PDF-exchange federation) and the intrinsic/extrinsic state
 * model; trust between the two instances is the DCS-NFR-BR-08 trusted-peer
 * safeguard, provisioned out-of-band (reciprocal DCS_TRUSTED_PEERS in the two
 * instances' Helm values, seeded at startup) — there is no runtime trust
 * endpoint by design, so the vertical asserts trust by observing replication
 * succeed, not by driving a trust stage.
