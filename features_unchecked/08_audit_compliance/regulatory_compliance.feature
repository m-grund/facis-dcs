Feature: Regulatory Framework Compliance
  The system validates contracts and logs against
  eIDAS, GDPR, and ISO regulatory frameworks.

  Scenario: Validate contract against eIDAS requirements
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract "Digital Agreement" requires eIDAS compliance
    When I validate contract "Digital Agreement" against "eIDAS"
    Then the electronic signatures are verified against eIDAS standards
    And the compliance status is recorded

  Scenario: Validate contract against GDPR requirements
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract "Data Processing Agreement" contains personal data clauses
    When I validate contract "Data Processing Agreement" against "GDPR"
    Then data protection clauses are verified
    And consent mechanisms are validated

  Scenario: Validate against ISO 27001 requirements
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Auditor"
    And contract "Security Services Agreement" requires ISO compliance
    When I validate contract "Security Services Agreement" against "ISO 27001"
    Then information security controls are verified
    And compliance status is recorded

  Scenario: Contract blocked for failing regulatory compliance
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract "Non-Compliant Agreement" fails eIDAS validation
    When I attempt to approve contract "Non-Compliant Agreement" for execution
    Then the contract is blocked from execution
    And the contract is flagged for manual review

  Scenario: Audit logs comply with eIDAS logging regulations
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Auditor"
    And audit logs exist for contract "Signed Agreement"
    When I validate audit logs against "eIDAS logging regulations"
    Then the logs meet timestamp accuracy requirements
    And the logs meet integrity requirements

  Scenario: Generate regulatory compliance certificate
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract "Validated Agreement" passes all regulatory checks
    When I generate compliance certificate for contract "Validated Agreement"
    Then a certificate is issued with validation timestamp
    And the certificate references the applicable frameworks
