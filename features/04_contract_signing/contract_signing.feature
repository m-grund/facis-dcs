Feature: Contract Signing
  Contract Signers review contracts in a secure viewer and apply
  legally binding digital signatures with identity and PoA credentials.

  Scenario: Sign contract in secure viewer
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Signer"
    And contract "Service Agreement" is in "Approved" status
    When I open contract "Service Agreement" in the secure viewer
    And I apply my digital signature to contract "Service Agreement"
    Then a signed artifact is produced
    And the contract status is updated to "Signed"
    And the signing action is logged with timestamp and signer ID

  Scenario: Signature includes identity and PoA credentials
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Signer"
    And I hold a valid identity credential issued by a recognized authority
    And I hold a valid PoA credential for organization "Acme Corp"
    When I apply my digital signature to contract "Service Agreement"
    Then the signature binds my identity credential
    And the signature binds my PoA credential
