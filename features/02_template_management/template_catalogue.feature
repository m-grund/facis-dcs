# Template catalogue integration (DCS-IR-SI-01, UC-02): POST /template/publish
# (backend/design/template_repository.go) pushes a REGISTERED template to the
# XFSC Federated Catalogue; GET /catalogue/template/retrieve and
# /catalogue/template/search (backend/design/template_catalogue_integration.go)
# read it back. The Federated Catalogue integration itself is already
# exercised indirectly (register-only path) by template_workflow.feature's
# "Register approved template" scenario; this file adds the publish/retrieve/
# search round-trip and its own RBAC scope, which that file does not cover.
