# PKI consolidation - PKCS#11 + SoftHSM2, ECDSA P-256, trust anchors, key
# rotation (SRS: DCS-IR-HI-01, DCS-NFR-SEC-02, DCS-OR-C2PA-007).
#
# Scope: all private-key material lives in the PKCS#11 token (SoftHSM2 in
# dev; backend/internal/base/hsm, provisioned by scripts/hsm-provision.sh).
# The pack proves the HSM-backed key surface end to end:
#   - the published DID key (GET /.well-known/did.json) and the OID4VP
#     authorization-request JWT (JAR) are ECDSA P-256 / ES256, signed by
#     their respective HSM labels;
#   - a PDF export's embedded Contract-Lifecycle-VC declares an ECDSA/ES256
#     proof suite;
#   - pdf-core holds NO signature material: it builds the COSE
#     Sig_structure bytes and calls the authenticated backend endpoint
#     POST /internal/c2pa/sign (backend/design/internal_signing.go), which
#     signs via hsm.Signer("dcs-c2pa"); the embedded C2PA manifest declares
#     COSE alg ES256(-7), not EdDSA(-8);
#   - (two-instance) the did:web peer-sync challenge is signed with the HSM
#     DID key and verified by the receiving instance against the
#     verificationMethod JWK;
#   - revoking the dev signing certificate in the CRL flips
#     /signature/validate from "no revocation finding" to "certificate
#     revoked";
#   - after a key rotation (new versioned label, active pointer moved; see
#     scripts/rotate-hsm-key.sh), a historical signature made with the OLD
#     key still validates while new signatures are attributed to the NEW
#     key version.
#
# The negative startup path ("missing/wrong PKCS#11 module path, token
# label, or PIN aborts startup hard") cannot be driven by this harness:
# there is exactly ONE already-running backend instance under test
# (BDD_DCS_BASE_URL), and no supervisor step can restart it with
# deliberately broken environment variables and assert the process never
# becomes reachable. Only the positive path is exercised as real,
# non-skipped evidence ("this reachable instance's own hsm.Open()-gated DID
# document is servable"); the negative path is an accepted ops-verification
# concern (start the backend once with a deliberately wrong
# PKCS11_MODULE_PATH/PKCS11_PIN and observe it never becomes healthy).

Feature: PKI consolidation - PKCS#11 + SoftHSM2, ECDSA P-256, trust anchors, rotation

  @DCS-IR-HI-01
  Scenario: A correctly PKCS#11-configured backend is reachable and serves its HSM-backed DID document
    # See the header comment for why only the positive path is modeled: a
    # reachable, 200-responding /.well-known/did.json can only happen if
    # main.go's hsm.Open() (which fails hard on a bad PKCS#11
    # module/token/PIN) already succeeded at startup.
    When I request this instance's own DID document
    Then get http 200:Success code

  @DCS-IR-HI-01
  Scenario: The published DID key is an ECDSA P-256 JWK, not an RSA JWK
    # Reuses the existing public DID-document endpoint as the test point
    # rather than inventing a test-only API. A full sign+verify round trip
    # (proving hsm.Signer(label) output verifies against
    # hsm.PublicJWK(label) end to end) is demonstrated for the
    # dcs-oid4vp-jar label in the JAR scenario below, and for the DID label
    # in the two-instance peer-sync scenario - this scenario is the
    # lighter-weight, single-instance structural proof that hsm.PublicJWK
    # for the DID key is wired to publish EC P-256, not RSA.
    When I request this instance's own DID document
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the DID document's verificationMethod key is an ECDSA P-256 JWK, not RSA

  @DCS-IR-HI-01
  Scenario: The OpenID4VP authorization request JWT (JAR) is ES256-signed by the dcs-oid4vp-jar HSM key
    When I start an OpenID4VP login and fetch the signed authorization request object
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the authorization request JWT is ES256-signed with an embedded EC P-256 JWK verifiable against itself
    And the authorization request JWT's kid names the dcs-oid4vp-jar HSM key label

  @DCS-IR-HI-01
  Scenario: The exported PDF's Contract-Lifecycle-VC proof is ECDSA/ES256, not Ed25519Signature2020
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
    And contract "PKI VC Proof Contract" is in "Draft" status
    When I export contract "PKI VC Proof Contract" as PDF
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the embedded contract-lifecycle VC proof for contract "PKI VC Proof Contract" is ECDSA/ES256, not Ed25519Signature2020

  @DCS-IR-HI-01 @two-instance
  Scenario: The peer-sync challenge is DID-key signed with ECDSA P-256 and verified on both instances
    # Reuses the existing two-instance Given/When/Then steps from
    # steps/peer_trust/dcs_peer_trust_steps.py rather than duplicating that
    # ~80-line setup: a successful offer replication between A and B can
    # only happen if BOTH instances' did:web challenge-response
    # signing/verification (base/identity/did.go Sign/Verify) works - which
    # means ECDSA P-256 end to end, on both instances simultaneously.
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    Then instance A and instance B each publish an ECDSA P-256 DID key, not RSA
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds

  @DCS-IR-HI-01
  Scenario: A full PDF export's embedded C2PA manifest declares COSE alg ES256, not EdDSA
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
    And contract "PKI C2PA COSE Alg Contract" is in "Draft" status
    When I export contract "PKI C2PA COSE Alg Contract" as PDF
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the exported PDF's C2PA COSE_Sign1 protected header declares alg ES256(-7), not EdDSA(-8)

  @DCS-NFR-SEC-02 @skip
  Scenario: DCS_TRUST_ANCHORS switches the trust-anchor source for all verification layers
    # @skip — deferred BY DECISION, not by test limitation. The swappable
    # trust-anchor source demands the "trust migration" the codebase itself
    # parks (sdjwt/keys.go: x5c accepted WITHOUT chain validation "until
    # chain validation lands with the trust migration"). That migration —
    # the issuer chain-walk to a trust anchor and issuer-authorization
    # validation beyond the known-roles check — is deliberately deferred
    # roadmap work (SRS TBD-B acknowledges the XFSC PCM ecosystem is not
    # yet testable). Landing DCS_TRUST_ANCHORS without it would either be a
    # config flag with no enforced semantics (false green) or a unilateral
    # pre-emption of a consciously deferred architecture decision. The tag
    # keeps the requirement's traceability present; the @skip keeps it out
    # of pass/fail counts.
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-007
  Scenario: Revoking the dev signing certificate in the CRL flips a previously valid signature to invalid
    Given contract "PKI CRL Revocation Contract" has reached contract state "SIGNED"
    And signature validation for contract "PKI CRL Revocation Contract" currently reports no certificate-revocation finding
    And the dev signing certificate used for contract "PKI CRL Revocation Contract"'s signature has been revoked in the CRL
    When I validate the signature for contract "PKI CRL Revocation Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And signature validation for contract "PKI CRL Revocation Contract" reports the certificate as revoked

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-007
  Scenario: A historical signature made with the old HSM key keeps validating after rotation, while a new signature uses the new key
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
    And contract "PKI Rotation Old Contract" has reached contract state "SIGNED"
    When I validate the signature for contract "PKI Rotation Old Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And signature validation for contract "PKI Rotation Old Contract" reports the signature as still valid after rotation
    Given the active dcs-contract-pades HSM key version has been rotated to a new version
    And contract "PKI Rotation New Contract" has reached contract state "SIGNED"
    When I validate the signature for contract "PKI Rotation Old Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And signature validation for contract "PKI Rotation Old Contract" reports the signature as still valid after rotation
    And the applied signatures for contracts "PKI Rotation Old Contract" and "PKI Rotation New Contract" are attributed to different HSM key versions
