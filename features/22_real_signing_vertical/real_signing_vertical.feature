# Real signing vertical - PAdES signature, EUDIPLO signing ceremony, PoA
# binding (SRS: DCS-FR-SM-08/-14/-16/-18, DCS-IR-SI-10, DCS-FR-CWE-04).
#
# Harness notes (see steps/real_signing_vertical/
# dcs_real_signing_vertical_steps.py's module docstring for the full
# rationale behind each binding decision):
#
#   1. pdf-core's own POST /sign is not reachable from this harness at all
#      (only the backend is, via BDD_DCS_BASE_URL) - PAdES is exercised
#      indirectly through POST /signature/apply and by inspecting the PDF
#      bytes GET /pdf/export/contract/{did} serves afterwards, using the
#      same direct-byte-search technique established elsewhere in this
#      codebase's BDD packs.
#   2. EUDIPLO is never co-deployed here; this harness plays the "EUDIPLO
#      test client" role itself, POSTing a real, protocol-correct SD-JWT VC +
#      KB-JWT PoA presentation straight at the ceremony webhook
#      (POST /signature/request/webhook, authenticated via the
#      X-EUDIPLO-Webhook-Secret shared-secret header), built with the
#      testWallet/dcs_wallet signing primitives.
#   3. Byte-level PDF assertions (SubFilter, x5chain, RFC3161 timestamp,
#      ByteRange coverage) are direct-byte-search heuristics, not a full PDF/
#      CMS/ASN.1 parse - each documents its own precision limit at its point
#      of use in the steps module.
#
# The Signature Manager UI (QR/poll/result modal, AES badge) has no coverage
# in this pack - this repo-root BDD harness has no browser-automation
# convention at all (see features/16_other/frontend.feature, a bare
# reachability check). The service-level contract the UI would call is
# already exercised by the ceremony scenarios below; the UI-specific
# rendering claims are recorded as an explicit coverage gap via the final
# @skip scenario, not fabricated.

Feature: Real signing vertical - PAdES signature, EUDIPLO ceremony, PoA binding

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PAdES signature production - pdf-core POST /sign, exercised indirectly
  # via POST /signature/apply after a completed ceremony (see steps module
  # docstring point 1).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: Applying a signature produces a PDF with a cryptographically valid PAdES signature in the named AcroForm field
    Given contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerOne"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" contains a PAdES signature naming AcroForm field "SignerOne"
    And the signed PDF for contract "RSV AcroForm Contract" has a structurally valid PAdES ByteRange

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The PAdES signature declares SubFilter ETSI.CAdES.detached with a full embedded x5chain
    Given contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerTwo"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" declares SubFilter ETSI.CAdES.detached
    And the signed PDF for contract "RSV SubFilter Contract" embeds a non-empty X.509 certificate chain

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The PAdES signature carries an RFC3161 timestamp from the configured TSA (PAdES-B-T)
    Given contract "RSV Timestamp Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerThree"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV Timestamp Contract" embeds an RFC3161 timestamp token

  # The TSA the PAdES timestamp uses is reached by PDF-CORE over HTTP at
  # runtime via pdf-core's own DCS_PDF_CORE_TSA_URL env
  # (deployment/helm/templates/pdf-core-deployment.yaml) — repointing THAT at
  # an unreachable address and rolling instance A's pdf-core takes the TSA
  # away from the PAdES path, which is the actual runtime condition PAdES-B-B
  # fallback (pdf-core/compiler/pades.go) exists for.
  #
  # Scaling the whole shared ORCE deployment to 0 would NOT work instead:
  # /signature/apply has a SECOND, independent ORCE dependency (the archive
  # notary, backend/internal/signingmanagement/command/apply.go ->
  # http://dcs-orce:1880/archive/notary) that HARD-FAILS the whole apply with
  # a 500 when ORCE is down, aborting before any PAdES-B-B PDF is persisted.
  # Only the PAdES timestamp path has a fallback; the archive-notary path
  # does not. Repointing pdf-core's TSA env isolates the PAdES path while
  # leaving ORCE (and the archive notary) up, so apply completes and yields a
  # genuine, inspectable B-B PDF.
  #
  # pdf-core is PER-RELEASE, so this only affects instance A, never instance
  # B or the shared ORCE — but it MUST still run under the suite-wide flock
  # for its entire duration, since any other agent signing via instance A
  # during the TSA-down window would unexpectedly get a B-B signature. See
  # steps/real_signing_vertical/dcs_real_signing_vertical_orce_steps.py.
  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002
  Scenario: PAdES-B-B fallback when the TSA is unavailable, and recovery to PAdES-B-T once it returns
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Manager"
    When pdf-core's RFC3161 TSA endpoint is made unavailable for this scenario
    And contract "RSV TSA Down Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerTsaDown", signed while the TSA is unavailable
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV TSA Down Contract" carries no RFC3161 timestamp token
    And pdf-core logged a PAdES-B-B fallback WARN
    When pdf-core's RFC3161 TSA endpoint is restored
    And contract "RSV TSA Recovered Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerTsaRecovered", signed after the TSA is restored
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV TSA Recovered Contract" embeds an RFC3161 timestamp token

  @DCS-OR-C2PA-002 @DCS-OR-C2PA-010
  Scenario: The order /update -> /sign -> /update leaves the PAdES signature and C2PA chain valid
    Given contract "RSV Order Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFour"
    When the signature for contract "RSV Order Contract" is revoked as a post-sign C2PA update
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When I re-export the signed PDF for contract "RSV Order Contract"
    Then the signed PDF for contract "RSV Order Contract" still has a structurally valid PAdES signature
    When contract "RSV Order Contract" is exported and verified as PDF
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the verification result shows match is true

  # Contract signer + apply flow
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-FR-SM-16 @DCS-IR-SI-10
  Scenario: The applied signature is a real PAdES signature persisted with an IPFS CID, not the stub placeholder
    Given contract "RSV No Stub Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFive"
    Then the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV No Stub Contract" is a real signature, not the STUB placeholder

  @FR-SM-18 @DCS-IR-SI-10
  Scenario: The apply endpoint honors the requested signer_did and credential_type instead of discarding them
    Given contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" is APPROVED and has completed a signing ceremony for signatory "ExplicitFieldsSigner"
    When contract signer applies a signature to contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" using the ceremony's signer_did and credential_type "AES"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signature envelope for contract "RSV Apply Fields Contract" reflects the ceremony's signer_did and credential_type "AES"

  @DCS-FR-SM-16 @FR-SM-25 @UC-04-02
  Scenario: Apply is refused with a typed error until a completed PoA presentation exists for the signer
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Gate Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When contract signer applies a signature to contract "RSV Ceremony Gate Contract" without a prior signing ceremony
    Then the apply request is rejected with a typed ceremony-required error

  @DCS-FR-CWE-04
  Scenario: The signature record binds both the PDF hash and the JSON-LD content hash
    Given contract "RSV Dual Hash Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerSix"
    Then the contract_signatures row for contract "RSV Dual Hash Contract" records both a PDF hash and a JSON-LD content hash

    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Denied Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Ceremony Denied Contract" field "SignerEight" as "Contract Observer"
    Then the ceremony start request is denied for that role

  @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: GET /signature/request/{id} reports the ceremony's lifecycle status as it progresses
    Given contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerNine"
    When I poll the signing ceremony status for contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And the signing ceremony for contract "RSV Ceremony Status Contract" has status "verified"

  @NFR-SEC-18 @FR-SM-14
  Scenario: The webhook receiver marks the ceremony verified and persists PoA claims when the shared secret is correct
    Given contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" field "SignerTen" as "Contract Signer"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When the EUDIPLO webhook confirms the presentation for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" with the correct shared secret
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When I poll the signing ceremony status for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract"
    Then the signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Auth Contract" has status "verified"

    Given contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" has reached contract state "APPROVED"
    When I start a signing ceremony for contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" field "SignerEleven" as "Contract Signer"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    When a caller posts the EUDIPLO webhook for contract "RSV Webhook Bad Secret Contract" with an incorrect shared secret
    Then the webhook request is rejected for the incorrect shared secret

  @UC-04-02

  @DCS-FR-SM-08 @NFR-SEC-18
  Scenario: The presented SD-JWT VC + KB-JWT is embedded verbatim before signing, inside the PAdES ByteRange
    Given contract "RSV Verbatim Presentation Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerThirteen"
    Then the SD-JWT VC presentation for contract "RSV Verbatim Presentation Contract" is embedded verbatim inside the PAdES ByteRange

    Given contract "RSV Summary VC Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerFourteen"
    Then a ContractSigningSummaryCredential for contract "RSV Summary VC Contract" is embedded inside the PAdES ByteRange

  # Uses the IPFS CID-swap seam (steps/support/tamper_seam.py). See
  # steps/real_signing_vertical/dcs_real_signing_vertical_tamper_steps.py's
  # module docstring for why the observable signal here is
  # /signature/validate's embedded-PoA cross-check finding, not a literal
  # PAdES cryptographic signature verdict — no endpoint reachable by this
  # harness re-verifies the CMS signature over its /ByteRange, and
  # pdf-core's own /verify treats the entire PAdES-signed span (including
  # the evidence attachment) as an opaque, unchecked suffix by design.
  @DCS-FR-SM-08
  Scenario: Corrupting the signature-evidence attachment invalidates the embedded-PoA cross-check
    Given contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" has an AES-signed PDF via a completed ceremony for signatory "SignerEvidenceTamper"
    When the signature-evidence attachment for contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" is corrupted on the server-stored PDF
    Then the signature validation findings for contract "RSV Evidence Tamper Contract" report the embedded signing evidence as invalid

  @UC-04-02 @UC-04-03

  Scenario: Signature Manager UI ceremony flow and AES badge - not provable from this HTTP-only BDD harness
    # This repo-root BDD harness has no browser-automation convention (see
    # features/16_other/frontend.feature - a bare reachability check). The
    # service-level contract the UI would call (start ceremony, poll status,
