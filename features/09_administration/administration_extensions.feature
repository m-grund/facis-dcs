Feature: Administration Extensions
  Recommended logging practices for authentication and authorization events.

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "System Administrator"
    And I have access to the administration dashboard

  Scenario: Log all authentication and authorization events
    Given the system processes user authentication
    When authentication or authorization occurs
    Then each event is logged with timestamp and user ID
    And logs are tamper-proof and auditable
