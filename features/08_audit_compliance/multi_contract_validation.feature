Feature: Multi-Contract Package Validation
  The system validates structural integrity of multi-contract packages
  ensuring completeness and proper linkage between components.

  Scenario: Validate complete multi-contract package
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract package "Enterprise Agreement" contains main contract and annexes
    When I validate structural integrity of package "Enterprise Agreement"
    Then all components are confirmed present
    And all linkages between components are verified

  Scenario: Detect missing component in package
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract package "Incomplete Package" is missing a required annex
    When I validate structural integrity of package "Incomplete Package"
    Then the validation flags "missing component: Data Protection Annex"
    And the package is blocked from execution

  Scenario: Detect misconfigured linkage in package
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Auditor"
    And contract package "Misconfigured Package" has broken component linkages
    When I validate structural integrity of package "Misconfigured Package"
    Then the validation flags "broken linkage between main contract and sub-agreement"
    And remediation guidance is provided

  Scenario: Validate frame agreement with sub-agreements
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract "Master Service Agreement" is a frame agreement
    And contract "Project SOW Alpha" is linked as sub-agreement
    And contract "Project SOW Beta" is linked as sub-agreement
    When I validate structural integrity of package "Master Service Agreement"
    Then the frame agreement structure is confirmed valid
    And all sub-agreements inherit required terms

  Scenario: Validate logical correctness of contract hierarchy
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Auditor"
    And contract package "Complex Agreement" has nested dependencies
    When I validate structural integrity of package "Complex Agreement"
    Then dependency order is verified
    And circular dependencies are detected and flagged

  Scenario: Generate structural validation report
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Compliance Officer"
    And contract package "Enterprise Agreement" has been validated
    When I generate structural validation report for package "Enterprise Agreement"
    Then I receive a report listing all components
    And the report shows linkage diagram and validation status

  Scenario: Package validation required before execution
    Given I am authenticated with roles: "Contract Approver"
    And contract package "Unvalidated Package" has not been structurally validated
    When I attempt to approve package "Unvalidated Package" for execution
    Then the request is denied
    And I receive error "Package requires structural validation"
