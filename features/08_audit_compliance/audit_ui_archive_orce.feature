# Minimal completion slice for the existing audit workstation and the archive
# integrity evidence created by the SIGNED transition. Continuous monitoring,

Feature: Minimal auditing workstation with archive integrity and ORCE evidence

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC1 @DCS-IR-PACM-01 @DCS-FR-CSA-24
  Scenario Outline: Auditor can run every audit scope with a DID and justification
    When the Auditor runs scope "<scope>" for DID "did:web:bdd.example:resource" with justification "external audit BDD-4711"
    Then the process audit request is accepted
    And every returned audit group belongs to scope "<scope>" and DID "did:web:bdd.example:resource"

    Examples:
      | scope      |
      | templates  |
      | contracts  |
      | signatures |
      | archive    |

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC1 @DCS-IR-CSA-04 @DCS-FR-CSA-24
  Scenario: Archive Manager is restricted to the archive audit scope
    When the Archive Manager runs scope "archive" with justification "archive control BDD-4712"
    Then the process audit request is accepted
    When the Archive Manager runs scope "contracts" with justification "scope escalation BDD-4713"
    Then the request is denied with an authorization error

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC1 @DCS-IR-PACM-01
  Scenario: Audit scope and justification are validated
    When the Auditor runs scope "unknown" with justification "scope validation BDD-4714"
    Then get http 400:Bad Request code
    When the Auditor runs scope "contracts" without a justification
    Then get http 400:Bad Request code

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC2 @DCS-IR-CSA-04 @DCS-FR-CSA-24
  Scenario: Archive integrity results carry unambiguous workstation semantics
    Given contract "Audit Semantics Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    When the Auditor runs scope "archive" for that contract with justification "semantic classification BDD-4715"
    Then the audit response distinguishes timeline events from integrity checks
    And every integrity check has a result, rule reference, and reason
    And the archive integrity result is passed

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC2 @DCS-IR-PACM-01
  @clean_db
  Scenario: An empty audit is an explicit successful state
    When the Auditor runs scope "archive" with justification "empty state BDD-4716"
    Then the audit response is a successful empty result

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC3 @DCS-FR-CSA-19 @UC-08-02
  Scenario: A valid archive entry passes each independent integrity rule
    Given contract "Valid Integrity Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    When the Auditor runs scope "archive" for that contract with justification "integrity proof BDD-4718"
    Then passed findings exist for DB snapshot, content hash, IPFS snapshot, ORCE receipt, ORCE chain, and RFC-3161 TSA

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC3 @DCS-FR-CSA-19 @UC-08-02
  Scenario Outline: Archive evidence defects are returned as individual failed findings
    Given contract "Defective Integrity Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    And its archived evidence is corrupted as "<defect>"
    When the Auditor runs scope "archive" for that contract with justification "negative integrity BDD-4719"
    Then get http 200:Success code
    And a failed archive finding with rule "<rule>" and a non-empty reason is returned

    Examples:
      | defect          | rule                 |
      | content hash    | ARCHIVE_CONTENT_HASH |
      | missing receipt | ARCHIVE_ORCE_RECEIPT |
      | invalid TSA     | ARCHIVE_TSA_RFC3161  |

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC4 @DCS-FR-CWE-20 @DCS-FR-CSA-18
  Scenario: SIGNED archival records real signing evidence without credential disclosure
    Given contract "Signing Evidence Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    Then its archive entry records signer, credential type, ceremony, field, signing time, PDF CID, and PDF hash
    And its archive entry stores credential hashes but no credential payload

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC4 @DCS-FR-CWE-20
  Scenario: ORCE continues the persisted chain after a restart
    Given the configured ORCE archive notary is reachable with its bearer token
    When archive event "bdd-restart-chain-first" is notarized
    And the ORCE archive flow is restarted
    And archive event "bdd-restart-chain-second" is notarized
    Then the second ORCE receipt references the first receipt hash

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC5 @DCS-FR-CSA-18
  Scenario: ORCE protects both append and retrieval with the configured bearer token
    Given the configured ORCE archive notary is reachable with its bearer token
    When the current ORCE audit log is remembered
    And archive event "bdd-unauthorized-append" is posted without a bearer token
    Then the ORCE request is unauthorized
    And the ORCE audit log is unchanged
    When the ORCE audit log is requested without a bearer token
    Then the ORCE request is unauthorized

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC5 @DCS-FR-CSA-18
  Scenario: ORCE append is idempotent and rejects conflicting reuse of an archive ID
    Given the configured ORCE archive notary is reachable with its bearer token
    When archive event "bdd-idempotent-entry" is notarized twice with identical content
    Then both ORCE responses contain the same receipt
    When archive event "bdd-idempotent-entry" is notarized with different content
    Then the ORCE request is rejected as a conflict

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC6 @DCS-IR-PACM-02 @UC-08-01 @UC-08-02
  Scenario Outline: Every report format contains the complete filtered audit result
    Given contract "Complete Report Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    When the Auditor exports scope "archive" for that contract as "<format>" with justification "external report BDD-4720"
    Then the "<format>" report contains lifecycle events with actors and timestamps
    And the "<format>" report contains archive findings with rule references and results
    And the exact delivered report bytes have a recorded SHA-256 hash and IPFS CID

    Examples:
      | format |
      | json   |
      | csv    |
      | pdf    |

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC7 @DCS-FR-CSA-18 @DCS-FR-CSA-24
  Scenario: Audit and export access records the actor and mandatory purpose
    When a Contract Manager runs scope "contracts" with justification "unauthorized audit BDD-4721"
    Then the request is denied with an authorization error
    And the denied audit access is logged with actor, roles, time, scope, and justification
    When the Auditor runs scope "contracts" with justification "authorized audit BDD-4722"
    Then the process audit request is accepted
    And the audit action is logged with actor, roles, time, scope, and justification

  @REQ-audit-ui-archive-orce-AC8 @DCS-IR-CSA-04 @DCS-FR-CSA-19 @DCS-FR-CSA-24
  Scenario: One damaged archive entry does not hide a valid entry and both audit routes agree
    Given contract "Healthy Archive Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    And contract "Damaged Archive Contract" is submitted, reviewed, approved, and signed via the standard workflow
    And its archived evidence is corrupted as "content hash"
    When the Auditor runs scope "archive" with justification "mixed archive BDD-4723"
    Then the archive audit contains a passed summary for "Healthy Archive Contract"
    And the archive audit contains a failed finding for "Damaged Archive Contract"
    And the PAC archive audit and archive audit endpoint return the same integrity findings
