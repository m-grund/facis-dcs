# Two-instance peer trust: the federation agreement credential + local
# policy endpoint (PDP), and cross-instance replication.
#
# ADR-19 (docs/adr-19-federation-agreement-credential.md) replaces the third
# trust layer this file used to describe as a static `trusted_peers`
# allowlist with two layers: (3a) each peer's self-signed agreement
# credential (W3C VC, published at
# GET /.well-known/dcs-agreement-credential.json) and (3b) a local,
# per-instance policy endpoint (PDP) consulted on every inbound/outbound
# interaction, fail-closed. The `trusted_peers` table, its `DCS_TRUSTED_PEERS`
# seeding, and `CheckForUntrustedPeers` are to be removed entirely (ADR-19
# decision item 4) — as of this writing that removal has not landed yet
# (backend/internal/service/dcs_to_dcs.go's PostPdf still calls the OLD
# CheckForUntrustedPeers), so every ADR-19 scenario below is expected to fail
# red; that is the point of writing them ahead of the implementation.
#
# The single-instance-testable scenarios ship as synthetic did:web peers the
# orce Node-RED fixture serves — one publishing no agreement credential at all
# (AC4), one whose credential names a deliberately wrong rules hash (AC5), and
# one whose credential verifies against this build's rules hash so only the PDP
# is left to decide (AC7 inbound, AC8, AC9) — plus, on the OUTBOUND path only,
# a case-varied spelling of this instance's own DID, which resolves to this
# instance's own key and credential. See
# steps/peer_trust/dcs_peer_trust_steps.py and
# steps/peer_trust/synthetic_trusted_peer.py for why each is honest evidence
# for the gate its own scenario names rather than for "any" rejection, and for
# the one sub-case still not simulatable (a present-but-signature-invalid
# credential — flagged as an open point at AC4).
#
# The @two-instance scenarios need a second real DCS process and
# BDD_DCS_BASE_URL_A/_B rather than the single-instance BDD_DCS_BASE_URL
# (locally via dev-stack2.sh, in CI via the dcs-a/dcs-b Helm releases).
#
# The AC7-AC10 PDP-gate scenarios drive the shared orce Node-RED flow's
# control surface (POST/GET {BDD_TRUST_PDP_CONTROL_URL}/trust-pdp/mode|last,
# default http://localhost:18880, the harness's own orce port-forward) —
# both DCS instances are wired with DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL=http://dcs-orce:1880/
# trust-pdp — see steps/peer_trust/dcs_trust_pdp_steps.py's module docstring.

@NFR-BR-08
Feature: Two-instance peer trust — federation agreement credential, PDP gate, and cross-instance replication

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC1 / AC2: the agreement credential itself (single-instance).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC1
  Scenario: The agreement credential names this instance's DID as issuer and its rules by policy ID and hash
    When I fetch this instance's own agreement credential
    Then the agreement credential is a W3C Verifiable Credential whose issuer is this instance's own DID
    And the agreement credential's termsOfUse names the federation rules by policyId and hash

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC2 @DCS-IR-SI-12
  Scenario: The agreement credential's signature verifies against the instance's own published VC key
    Given I fetch this instance's own agreement credential
    Then the credential's proof verifies against the key it names, which this instance publishes for assertions and not for authentication

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC3: both instances of the same build agree — same rules hash, and an
  # offer replicates end to end once both sides' PDPs allow it.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC3 @two-instance
  Scenario: Both instances of the same build publish the same federation rules hash
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    Then instance A and instance B's agreement credentials name the identical federation rules hash

  @NFR-BR-08 @REQ-fed-agreement-AC3 @two-instance @DCS-NFR-SQ-06
  Scenario: A contract offered on instance A appears on its counterparty B
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DCS-IR-SI-06 / DCS-FR-SM-02: GET /peer/contracts/provenance
  # (backend/design/dcs_to_dcs.go, get_provenance) is the read-only peer
  # contract-information endpoint: it answers with the stored JAdES
  # provenance artifact for a contract received from a peer, so instance B
  # can prove WHO shipped it the contract content it holds.
  #
  # A proposal ship carries no JAdES by design ("empty for a proposal",
  # DCSToDCSContractPdfRequest), so the artifact exists only after a
  # signature ship: A signs, the synchronizer attaches its instance-key
  # JAdES over the contract (jadesForSignedContract), and B's PostPdf
  # verifies it against A's published did:web key and the PDF's own
  # embedded payload before persisting it (verifyShippedJades →
  # SyncRepository.UpsertSyncSignature).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-IR-SI-06 @DCS-FR-SM-02 @two-instance
  Scenario: A contract received from instance A carries instance A's verifiable JAdES provenance on B
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    Then instance B stores a JAdES sync-provenance artifact for that contract signed by instance A

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DCS-NFR-BR-06 Revocation & Termination Propagation: revoking a
  # signature MUST take immediate effect and be propagated across dependent
  # systems — including the counterparty instance.
  #
  # Under the PDF-exchange model (ADR-13) each instance runs its own
  # workflow, so A drives review/approval locally, signs, and revokes; the
  # synchronizer ships the revocation (REVOKE_SIGNATURE trigger, REVOKED in
  # shippableStates, declared via contract_state on the wire) and the
  # receiver adopts REVOKED as the single exception to intrinsic-state
  # privacy — the authenticated counterparty revoking its own signature
  # voids the agreement regardless of B's local workflow progress
  # (receivepdf.go AdoptRevoked).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-NFR-BR-06 @two-instance
  Scenario: Signature revocation on instance A propagates REVOKED to instance B
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    And instance A revokes the applied signature of the cross-instance contract
    Then the contract state "REVOKED" is replicated on both instance A and instance B

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC4: PostPdf rejects a peer with a missing agreement credential. The
  # shipping peer is the orce trust-PDP flow's synthetic-peer route
  # (deployment/helm/charts/orce/flows/): it mirrors this instance's own
  # did.json (layers 1/2 genuinely verify) but its own agreement-credential
  # endpoint deliberately 404s — see
  # steps/peer_trust/dcs_peer_trust_steps.py's
  # _orce_synthetic_peer_did/_orce_synthetic_peer_credentials. Replaces an
  # earlier "sign with our own key, resolve back to our own now-implemented
  # endpoint" technique that stopped being honest once that endpoint started
  # returning 200 instead of 404.
  #
  # OPEN POINT: the "signature-invalid" half of AC4 ("fehlendem/
  # signatur-ungültigem Agreement-Credential") is still NOT covered by a
  # scenario here — the synthetic-peer route only produces a MISSING
  # credential (404), not a present-but-badly-signed one. Flagged for the
  # analyst/architect rather than forced into a fake scenario.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC4 @DCS-NFR-BR-02
  Scenario: PostPdf rejects a peer that publishes no agreement credential at all
    Given a cryptographically valid peer identity
    And that peer publishes no agreement credential
    And contract "AC4 Missing Credential" exists locally, created by this instance
    When that peer ships contract "AC4 Missing Credential"'s PDF to this instance's PostPdf endpoint
    Then the PDF is rejected because the peer's agreement credential does not verify

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC5 (@two-instance): sender-side refusal to ship towards a peer whose
  # agreement credential is VALIDLY SIGNED but names a deliberately WRONG
  # rules hash — the SECOND orce static synthetic peer
  # (step_given_counterparty_synthetic_peer_mismatched_hash,
  # did:web:dcs-orce-mismatch%3A1880 by default). Reformulated from an
  # earlier inbound/PostPdf/two-BUILD-variant draft to the same
  # outbound/sender-side shape AC6 already uses (reusing its Then-steps):
  # the hash-comparison gate condition is exercised identically either way,
  # honestly, without needing a second deployment BUILD (only a second
  # static peer identity, which now exists).
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC5 @two-instance
  Scenario: An offer towards a peer whose agreement credential names a different rules hash is refused
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the counterparty is a synthetic peer whose agreement credential names a different rules hash
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then instance A does not ship the PDF and a sync_fails retry entry exists for the cross-instance contract
    And an incident report naming instance A's refusal to ship is recorded in instance A's audit trail

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC6 (@two-instance): sender-side refusal to ship without a valid,
  # hash-matching peer credential — sync_fails + incident on the SENDER's
  # own side. The counterparty is overridden to the orce synthetic-peer
  # route (same identity as AC4's, see
  # step_given_counterparty_synthetic_peer_no_credential), whose
  # agreement-credential endpoint deliberately 404s — real instance B's own
  # endpoint is now implemented and would actually verify, defeating the
  # point of this scenario.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC6 @two-instance
  Scenario: Instance A refuses to ship without a valid agreement credential from instance B
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the counterparty is a synthetic peer with no valid agreement credential
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then instance A does not ship the PDF and a sync_fails retry entry exists for the cross-instance contract
    And an incident report naming instance A's refusal to ship is recorded in instance A's audit trail

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC7: the local policy endpoint (PDP) is consulted on every interaction,
  # in- and outbound; a 2xx response lets it proceed. Single-instance, orce
  # trust-PDP flow in "allow" mode.
  #
  # The inbound scenarios (AC7 inbound, AC8, AC9) ship as the THIRD orce
  # synthetic peer, did:web:dcs-orce-trusted%3A1880: a separate authority whose
  # agreement credential verifies against the running build's federation rules
  # hash, so layer 3a passes and the PDP is the only gate left to decide the
  # interaction. It is neither this instance (which PostPdf's same-peer guard,
  # identity.SameDIDWeb, refuses before any trust layer runs) nor the
  # credential-less route AC4 uses. Its key material and credential are minted
  # per run by the harness and published through the orce flow's control
  # surface (steps/peer_trust/synthetic_trusted_peer.py) rather than checked in,
  # because a static credential's rules hash stops matching the build the day
  # the rules document changes.
  #
  # "The policy endpoint was consulted" is likewise read per contract
  # (GET /trust-pdp/last?contractDID=...), not as the control surface's global
  # last request — which any earlier consult in the run already satisfied.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC7
  Scenario: An inbound PostPdf interaction consults the local policy endpoint before proceeding
    Given the local policy endpoint (PDP) is running and allows every request
    And a cryptographically valid peer whose agreement credential this instance accepts
    And contract "AC7 Inbound PDP Consult" exists locally, created by this instance
    When that peer ships contract "AC7 Inbound PDP Consult"'s PDF to this instance's PostPdf endpoint
    Then the policy endpoint was consulted for this interaction

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC7
  Scenario: An outbound ship consults the local policy endpoint before proceeding
    Given the local policy endpoint (PDP) is running and allows every request
    And contract "AC7 Outbound PDP Consult" exists locally, offered to a peer counterparty, created by this instance
    When this instance ships contract "AC7 Outbound PDP Consult"'s PDF towards its peer counterparty
    Then the policy endpoint was consulted for this interaction

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC8: PDP non-2xx -> denial + exactly one incident (Deny is TERMINAL per
  # the architect's decision — no sync_fails retry entry for a Deny). The
  # incident count is scoped to THIS scenario's own contract DID — an
  # unscoped global count is unreliable in a shared long-lived environment
  # where earlier/orphaned denials can already have raised unrelated
  # incidents. Both the rejection and the incident must name the policy
  # endpoint: the peer's credential verifies, so a denial attributed to the
  # credential check would be this scenario passing for the wrong reason.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC8
  Scenario: A denying policy endpoint rejects the interaction with exactly one incident and no retry
    Given the local policy endpoint (PDP) is running and denies every request
    And a cryptographically valid peer whose agreement credential this instance accepts
    And contract "AC8 PDP Deny" exists locally, created by this instance
    When that peer ships contract "AC8 PDP Deny"'s PDF to this instance's PostPdf endpoint
    Then the interaction is denied and exactly one incident is recorded in the audit trail for contract "AC8 PDP Deny"
    And no sync_fails retry entry exists for contract "AC8 PDP Deny"

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC9: the PDP request body carries the documented fields. Checked via the
  # orce control flow's GET /trust-pdp/last?contractDID=..., which reports the
  # request recorded for THIS scenario's contract — not an exact request COUNT,
  # unlike the retired local-stub version of this pack, and not the run's
  # global last request, which said nothing about this interaction. The peer
  # and contract it names are asserted against what the scenario shipped, and
  # agreementCredential is non-empty only because layer 3a accepted this peer's
  # credential first.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC7 @REQ-fed-agreement-AC9
  Scenario: The policy endpoint receives peerDID, agreementCredential, direction, contractDID, and targetState
    Given the local policy endpoint (PDP) is running and allows every request
    And a cryptographically valid peer whose agreement credential this instance accepts
    And contract "AC9 PDP Body Shape" exists locally, created by this instance
    When that peer ships contract "AC9 PDP Body Shape"'s PDF to this instance's PostPdf endpoint
    Then the policy endpoint recorded a request naming the peer, the agreement credential, the direction, the contract, and the target state

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC10: DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL unreachable -> fail-closed denial + incident.
  #
  # Unified terminal semantics (architect decision): EVERY PDP failure mode —
  # non-2xx deny, unset DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL, or an unreachable endpoint — is
  # equally terminal: the interaction is rejected, exactly one incident is
  # recorded, and NO sync_fails retry entry is created for a PDP-caused
  # rejection (unlike AC6's agreement-credential-caused refusal, which DOES
  # get a sync_fails entry — that is a different gate). There is therefore no
  # "transient, keeps retrying" sub-case to distinguish here; this scenario's
  # Then-steps are identical in shape to AC8's deny scenario.
  #
  # OPEN POINT: the OTHER AC10 sub-case — DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL entirely UNSET —
  # is not covered here. It is a backend-startup-time env var fixed for the
  # life of the running process; exercising it needs a dedicated deployment
  # variant with the var deliberately absent (no analogue to
  # tests/bdd/Makefile's single-purpose kind_up_audit stack exists for this
  # yet). Flagged rather than silently only testing the reachable sub-case
  # under this AC's name.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC10
  Scenario: An unreachable policy endpoint fails closed with exactly one incident and no retry
    Given the local policy endpoint (PDP) is not reachable
    And contract "AC10 PDP Unreachable" exists locally, offered to a peer counterparty, created by this instance
    When this instance ships contract "AC10 PDP Unreachable"'s PDF towards its peer counterparty
    Then the outbound ship attempt is denied and exactly one incident is recorded in the audit trail for contract "AC10 PDP Unreachable"
    And no sync_fails retry entry exists for contract "AC10 PDP Unreachable"

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # AC11 (@two-instance): the wired default Node-RED flow
  # (deployment/helm/charts/orce/flows/trust-pdp-flow.json) answers 200 OK
  # and mutual trust runs through it. Still gated behind an explicit Given
  # (see step_given_default_pdp_flow_wired) whose env var the coordinator
  # sets once a given harness run has confirmed both instances'
  # DCS_TRUST_PDP_URL wiring is live, rather than assuming the flow file's
  # mere presence in the chart means it.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @REQ-fed-agreement-AC11 @two-instance
  Scenario: Mutual trust between instances runs through the default Node-RED policy flow
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    And the default trust-PDP Node-RED flow is wired on both instances
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DCS-NFR-BR-03 (@two-instance): a contract lacking its required
  # signatures must not proceed to deployment or execution — including
  # across the federation, where each party's signature row stays in its own
  # database and the signature fields are named for the PARTIES (create.go
  # seedSignatureFields). Both instances designate a target BEFORE signing,
  # so the auto-deploy subscriber (DCS-FR-CWE-06) has a destination and its
  # own run of the gate is observable: an ungated deployment would be
  # dispatched to the ORCE contract-target flow and its acknowledgement
  # would move the contract to ACTIVE.
  #
  # The counterparty's field is satisfied by the JAdES that peer ships with
  # its own signed copy (DCS-FR-SM-02, verified on receipt against the
  # peer's published assertion key) — the evidence in the AC above — and by
  # nothing else, so half-signed refuses and countersigned proceeds.
  #
  # SETTLEMENT AND SIGNATURE ARE TWO DIFFERENT MILESTONES, and this scenario
  # only holds because they are: BOTH parties settle first (each side's own
  # NEGOTIATION -> SUBMITTED ships its settlement artifact to the other, and
  # neither may sign before it holds the other's), and only then does A sign
  # alone. B is settled-but-unsigned for the two refusal assertions in the
  # middle, which is exactly the state the deployment gate is about.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-NFR-BR-03 @DCS-FR-SM-07 @DCS-FR-CWE-06 @two-instance
  Scenario: A federated contract deploys only once both parties have signed
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A points the cross-instance contract at its own target system
    And instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    Then a manual deployment of the cross-instance contract on instance A is rejected because signing is incomplete
    And the cross-instance contract on instance A does not activate while the counterparty has not signed
    When instance B points the cross-instance contract at its own target system
    And instance B applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    Then the cross-instance contract on instance B activates automatically once both parties have signed
    And a manual deployment of the cross-instance contract on instance A is accepted once the counterparty has countersigned

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # THE MUTUAL-SETTLEMENT GATE ITSELF (backend/internal/signingmanagement/
  # command/apply.go assertCounterpartiesSettled, reached from both
  # /signature/prepare and /signature/submit).
  #
  # Every scenario above shows the gate letting a signature through once both
  # parties settled. These two are the other half — what it refuses — because
  # a gate only ever observed passing is indistinguishable from no gate.
  #
  # Signing claims both parties agreed the same document. ADR-13 keeps
  # intrinsic state local, so this instance reaching APPROVED says nothing
  # about the counterparty: the only thing that does is the settlement
  # artifact the peer signs and ships on its own NEGOTIATION -> SUBMITTED. The
  # refusal is its own API code, counterparty_not_settled — "the contract is
  # waiting for the counterparty", not "you may not sign" — and the signer's
  # state is otherwise complete, ceremony included.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-FR-SM-02 @two-instance
  Scenario: Instance A may not sign before instance B has settled the same document
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A attempts a ceremony-backed signature on the contract
    Then the signature attempt on instance A is refused because the counterparty has not settled
    When instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    Then instance A holds an applied signature for its own party field

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # The version binding, from the outside. A settlement is a statement about
  # ONE version of ONE document, bound by the SHA-256 of its JCS
  # canonicalization — never by contract_version, which is a per-instance
  # counter (the sender bumps it on merging a redline, the receiver on every
  # inbound ship) and so cannot be compared across the boundary.
  #
  # The artifact shipped here is genuine in every other respect: instance A's
  # own key, its own identity, addressed to instance B, for a contract B holds
  # and a party B knows. Only the document digest names something else — so
  # the refusal can come from nothing but the digest binding, and the
  # signature that settlement would have authorised stays refused.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-FR-SM-02 @two-instance
  Scenario: A settlement naming another document authorises no signature
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A ships instance B a settlement naming a document instance B does not hold
    Then instance B refuses the settlement because it covers another document
    When instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance B attempts a ceremony-backed signature on the contract
    Then the signature attempt on instance B is refused because the counterparty has not settled

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # TAKING AN AGREEMENT BACK (contractworkflowengine/command/
  # settledagreement.go withdrawOwnSettlement, on submit.go's reviewer-reject
  # branch and on reject.go's approver rejection).
  #
  # A party that settled is held to the version it settled: while its own
  # settlement names the document it stores, every command that would persist
  # a different one is refused (requireUnsettledAgreement, from /contract/
  # submit's new contract_data and from a structured redline alike). That
  # refusal is only legitimate because the party has a way to change its mind,
  # and this scenario is that way — without it the gate is a deadlock rather
  # than a gate, and the round that reached SUBMITTED could never be reopened
  # to say anything new.
  #
  # The way out is the rejection the workflow already had: sending the
  # submission back reopens the negotiation tasks, so it also withdraws the
  # agreement whose transition it undoes. Read directly from
  # contract_settlements on both sides of the rejection, because the row IS
  # the statement — a scenario that only observed the redline succeeding would
  # equally pass on an instance that had never settled at all.
  #
  # The rest of the scenario is what makes the withdrawal correct rather than
  # merely permissive: the next round settles the REDLINED document, both
  # parties settle that same version, and the signature the mutual gate then
  # allows is a signature over the document both of them last agreed to.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  @DCS-IR-CWE-03 @DCS-FR-SM-02 @two-instance
  Scenario: Reopening a round takes instance A's agreement back, and the version it settles instead is the one that signs
    Given instance A and instance B are both running and trust each other
    When the initiator on instance A creates and offers a contract with instance B as counterparty
    Then the contract appears on instance B in state OFFERED within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to SUBMITTED through its own local workflow
    Then instance A holds its own settlement of the contract as it stands
    When instance A's reviewer rejects the submission back into negotiation
    Then instance A holds no settlement of its own for the contract
    When instance A redlines the reopened contract
    Then the redlined document reaches instance B within a few seconds
    When instance A drives the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    Then instance A holds its own settlement of the contract as it stands
    When instance B drives its own copy of the contract to APPROVED through its own local workflow
    And instance A applies a ceremony-backed signature to the contract
    Then instance A holds an applied signature for its own party field
