# Identity and PoA Credential Acquisition (UC-14). PID credential acquisition,
# verification, and binding to the signing session IS implemented and
# exercised end-to-end by 22_real_signing_vertical/real_signing_vertical.
# feature (EUDIPLO ceremony, SD-JWT VC + KB-JWT presentation, embedded under
# the PAdES signature) — not duplicated here.

# PoA disposition per entscheidungen_zu_den_blockern.txt ("Credential zum
# Login"): the PoA credential (dc+sd-jwt, vct urn:dcs:poa:v1, holder-bound)
# is presented at LOGIN — every session starts with an OpenID4VP PoA
# presentation whose organization/role attributes are mapped into the Hydra
# session, and the credential's revocation status is checked in every verify
# path. Presentation + status verification are therefore exercised by every
# authenticated scenario in this suite. What remains open (deviation 8 of
# that document, backed by SRS TBD-B: the XFSC PCM wallet ecosystem is not
# yet available for testing) is the ISSUER CHAIN-WALK: verifying that the
# PoA's issuer is itself legitimized up to a trust anchor. The scenarios
# below assert exactly that chain-walk and stay @skip until it lands.

Feature: Power-of-Attorney credential verification at signing

  # @skip: asserts the PoA issuer chain-walk to a trusted root — roadmap per
  # deviation 8 (entscheidungen_zu_den_blockern.txt); presentation + status
  # check of the PoA itself happen at login and are covered suite-wide.

  Scenario: Signer presents a PoA credential proving delegated signing authority
    Given I hold a PoA credential compliant with eIDAS framework for organization "BDD Org"
    When I present the PoA credential during the signing ceremony
    Then the PoA credential chain is verified to a trusted root
    And the signature is bound to the delegated authority

  # @skip: distinguishing a chain-invalid PoA (issuer not anchored) from a
  # merely revoked one needs the same chain-walk verifier — same deviation-8
  # roadmap item. Plain revocation blocking is live in every verify path.

  Scenario: A revoked PoA credential blocks signing
    Given I hold a revoked PoA credential for organization "BDD Org"
    When I attempt to initiate signing for contract "PoA Revoked Contract"
    Then the request is denied with a client error
