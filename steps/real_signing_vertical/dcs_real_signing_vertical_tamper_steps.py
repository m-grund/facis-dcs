"""Step definitions for real_signing_vertical.feature's AC16 scenario
("Removing the signature-evidence attachment invalidates the embedded-PID
cross-check"), using the IPFS CID-swap seam (steps/support/tamper_seam.py)
to get a corrupted, server-STORED signed PDF the same way contract_format_
review.feature's "Tampered PDF fails hash verification" and c2pa_
conformance.feature's AC4 do.

--- Why this corrupts the evidence stream bytes IN PLACE rather than
deleting the attachment ---

pdf-core embeds the signing evidence (SD-JWT VC + KB-JWT PID presentation +
ContractSigningSummaryCredential) as a PDF embedded-file object BEFORE
applying the PAdES signature (embed-first-sign-second — pdf-core/compiler/
signing_evidence.go's EmbedSigningEvidence), so its bytes fall inside the
PAdES signature's /ByteRange-covered region. Actually DELETING the
attachment (shrinking the file) would shift every subsequent byte offset,
corrupting the PDF's own xref table and /ByteRange fields — the PDF would
stop parsing altogether, which is a different (uninteresting) failure mode.
Flipping bytes strictly WITHIN the embedded-file stream's data (same
length, same offsets, found via the same filespec/EF/object/stream-marker
walk as pdf-core's own ExtractSigningEvidence in that file) keeps the PDF
otherwise well-formed while genuinely destroying the evidence content —
exactly the "mutate bytes inside the signed ByteRange" seam the task
describes.

--- Why the observable signal is /signature/validate's PID cross-check,
not a "PAdES signature is now invalid" claim ---

No endpoint reachable from this black-box harness cryptographically
re-verifies the PAdES CMS signature over its /ByteRange (grepping pdf-core
confirms no such check exists — see compiler/compiler_verify.go, which only
does C2PA page-content-coverage checks). Moreover pdf-core's own /verify
(reached via GET /pdf/verify/contract/{did} and POST /signature/validate's
"Document integrity check") treats the entire PAdES-signed span — including
the evidence attachment — as an OPAQUE, unchecked suffix by design (see
compiler/update.go's VerifyIncrementalUpdate docstring: "a PAdES signature
and its signing-evidence attachment may sit, opaque to this check, between
any two updates"). So corrupting the evidence bytes is invisible to both of
those checks. The ONE place this codebase actually re-derives meaning from
the evidence attachment is backend/internal/signingmanagement/query/
validate.go's crossCheckEmbeddedPID, which extracts it via pdf-core's
POST /evidence/extract and JSON-decodes it to re-verify the embedded PID
presentation. Corrupting the evidence bytes makes that JSON decode fail,
which crossCheckEmbeddedPID surfaces as a genuine, real, distinctly-worded
validation finding ("Embedded signing evidence is missing the PID
presentation") in place of its normal positive finding ("Embedded PID
presentation re-verified and cross-checked against the signature record").
That finding — a real behavioral difference this codebase's actual code
produces — is what this scenario asserts on, rather than a fabricated
"PAdES cryptographic signature invalid" claim this harness cannot honestly
prove.
