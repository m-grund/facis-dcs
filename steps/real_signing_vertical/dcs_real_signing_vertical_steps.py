"""BDD step definitions for the real signing vertical
(features/22_real_signing_vertical; SRS DCS-FR-SM-08/-14/-16/-18,
DCS-IR-SI-10, DCS-FR-CWE-04): PAdES signing, the wallet-driven signing ceremony,
and PID binding.

--- Binding decisions this pack relies on ---

1. pdf-core's own POST /sign is NOT reachable from this harness: the BDD
   runner only ever talks to the backend (BDD_DCS_BASE_URL); pdf-core sits
   behind the backend's internal network path (see
   backend/internal/pdfgeneration/pdfcore/client.go). The PAdES scenarios
   therefore exercise signing indirectly through the prepare/submit wallet
   ceremony (ADR-12/ADR-20, no /signature/apply anymore — that transitional
   DCS-as-signatory path is removed) and inspect the PDF bytes the backend
   serves afterwards via GET /pdf/export/contract/{did} - the same
   "black-box HTTP only" discipline established throughout this codebase's
   BDD packs. The pdf-core-level, pyHanko-based cryptographic conformance
   proof lives in pdf-core's own behave harness (pdf-core/features/), out of
   scope for this repo-root harness.

2. The ceremony endpoints POST /signature/request, GET
   /signature/request/{ceremony_id}, and POST
   /signature/request/{ceremony_id}/callback are defined in
   backend/design/signature_management.go.

3. EUDIPLO is not a dependency of this DCS (ADR-20: the remote EUDIPLO PID
   service was broken and is removed). Ceremony PID+PoA verification is
   wallet-presented OID4VP: THIS HARNESS plays the wallet, direct_post'ing a
   real, protocol-correct SD-JWT VC + KB-JWT vp_token — carrying BOTH the PID
   and the Power of Attorney presentation, keyed by their DCQL credential
   query ids — straight to the ceremony's own callback
   (POST /signature/request/{ceremony_id}/callback), the same endpoint the
   signed-document callback later reuses once the ceremony is published. Both
   presentations are built with the existing testWallet/dcs_wallet signing
   primitives, the same library AuthService already uses for the OID4VP login
   flow, just with PID-shaped claims (vct urn:dcs:pid:demo:v1, given_name/
   family_name) instead of the role-credential shape, and bound to the
   ceremony's own request nonce (fetched from its pending-stage request
   object, never invented locally).

4. The callback is authenticated by the unguessable ceremony id in the URL,
   not a shared secret (ADR-12) — there is no separate webhook auth step to
   test. What IS still tested here: a presentation whose KB-JWT nonce does
   not match the ceremony's own request nonce is rejected (the same
   cryptographic binding a shared secret would have gated, without a secret
   to leak or rotate).

5. Several byte-level PDF assertions (SubFilter, x5chain presence, RFC3161
   timestamp token, ByteRange coverage) use the same "direct-byte-search
   over the raw, uncompressed PDF bytes" technique established in
   steps/pdf_generation/pdf_steps.py and
   steps/pki_consolidation/dcs_pki_consolidation_steps.py rather than a
   full PDF/CMS/ASN.1 parse. Each such check documents its own precision
   limits at its point of use.

The PAdES-B-B TSA-fallback scenario is driven via pdf-core's own
DCS_PDF_CORE_TSA_URL env (see dcs_real_signing_vertical_orce_steps.py); the
evidence-tamper scenario uses the IPFS CID-swap seam (see
dcs_real_signing_vertical_tamper_steps.py). The Signature Manager UI
(QR/poll/result flow, AES badge) has no coverage here: no browser
automation exists in this BDD stack, the service-level contract is
exercised by the ceremony scenarios, and the UI-specific claims are
recorded as an explicit coverage gap via the @skip placeholder scenario at
the bottom of the feature file, not a fabricated pass.
