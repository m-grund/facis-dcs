"""BDD steps for two-instance peer trust (features/17_peer_trust; SRS
NFR-BR-08, DCS-FR-CWE-01/-15) AND for the federation agreement credential /
PDP gate (ADR-19, docs/adr-19-federation-agreement-credential.md, requirement
slug `fed-agreement`).

ADR-19 replaces the third trust layer this module used to exercise — the
static `trusted_peers` allowlist table, which this file used to seed directly
via an `INSERT INTO trusted_peers` test seam (`_seed_trusted_peer`, removed) —
with an agreement-credential check (layer 3a) plus a local, per-instance
policy endpoint (PDP, layer 3b), fail-closed. The
`trusted_peers` table, its `DCS_TRUSTED_PEERS` seeding, and
`CheckForUntrustedPeers` are to be removed entirely (ADR-19 decision item 4);
until that removal actually lands, `backend/internal/service/dcs_to_dcs.go`'s
`PostPdf` still calls the old `CheckForUntrustedPeers` first, so the
peer-identity Given step below only produces a cryptographically valid
synthetic peer identity — no DB seeding, and no assumption about whether the
OLD allowlist will incidentally also reject it. Trust/deny for the NEW model
is controlled entirely via the orce trust-PDP flow's control surface (see
steps/peer_trust/dcs_trust_pdp_steps.py, Given "the local policy endpoint
(PDP) is running and allows/denies every request") and via the
agreement-credential Given steps below (missing/invalid credential).

Untrusted-peer single-instance testing technique
------------------------------------------------
The did:web challenge-response signature (see backend/internal/service/
dcs_to_dcs.go's PostPdf): the caller signs a fresh `secret_value` with its
private key, and the receiving instance resolves the peer's did:web
identifier to a document URL (`identity.FetchDIDDocument` ->
`DIDWebPath`/`DIDWebDocumentPath`) to fetch the matching public key.

Resolution follows did-method-web, so PATH SEGMENTS ARE PART OF THE
IDENTITY: `did:web:<host>:<suffix>` resolves to
`https://<host>/<suffix>/did.json`, NOT to `<host>`'s
`/.well-known/did.json`. A synthetic peer therefore cannot be minted by
appending an arbitrary suffix to this instance's own DID — that names a
document this instance does not serve, and PostPdf then fails at its very
first step (FetchDIDDocument) long before any trust-gate layer runs.

What DOES yield a self-resolving synthetic peer is letter case: DNS names are
case-insensitive, so flipping the case of one host letter produces a DIFFERENT
DID STRING that reaches the SAME authority (see
`_self_resolving_peer_variant`). Such an identifier resolves to THIS SAME
running instance's own `/.well-known/did.json`, its own
`/.well-known/dcs-agreement-credential.json` and its own signing key, so
layers 1/2 (challenge-response) and layer 3a (agreement credential: valid
signature, issuer resolving to the same target, matching rules hash) all pass
GENUINELY, leaving layer 3b — the PDP — as the only gate under test.

OUTBOUND ONLY. PostPdf's same-peer guard compares did:web identifiers by what
they denote (`identity.SameDIDWeb`), so inbound this identity is exactly what
that guard exists to refuse — "shipping a contract PDF to the same peer is not
allowed", before any trust layer runs. It is used where the ship goes the other
way (`step_given_local_contract_offered_to_peer`), which applies no such guard.
Inbound scenarios take an orce route instead, which is genuinely another
authority: the one in this module (`_orce_synthetic_peer_credentials`) 404s its
agreement credential and so exercises a layer-3a REFUSAL, and the one in
steps/peer_trust/synthetic_trusted_peer.py publishes a credential that verifies
against the running build's rules hash and so leaves the PDP (layer 3b) as the
only gate an inbound scenario still has to pass.

Consequence: this identity is CONSTANT per instance rather than unique per
scenario (uniqueness would require a distinguishing path segment, which is
exactly what resolution now makes meaningful). Nothing here needs a unique
peer — every assertion is scoped by the scenario's own contract DID, and
`RecordDenialIncidentTxDeduped` dedupes on (contract DID, peer DID,
direction), whose contract-DID component is already per-scenario unique.

A peer with a MISSING credential (layer 3a fails) is simulated separately via
the orce synthetic-peer route (`_orce_synthetic_peer_credentials`), one with a
valid-but-wrong-hash credential via a second orce route
(`_orce_mismatch_peer_credentials`), and one whose credential actually verifies
via a third (`synthetic_trusted_peer.publish_trusted_peer`) — this instance
cannot be made to publish a broken credential about itself. A
"signature-invalid" credential remains uncovered and is flagged as an open
point at its scenario rather than faked.

This technique is the natural single-instance extension of the self-peer
simulation used by the contract-state-machine pack (see
steps/template_management/contract_state_machine_steps.py,
`_self_peer_action_credentials`), adapted here to also cover the PostPdf
same-peer guard.

    the gate under test runs INSIDE prepare, after the ceremony and after the

    - "this instance has not settled ..." is this instance's OWN bookkeeping,
      written by the outbox handler that ships the settlement, so it trails its
      own SUBMITTED by a moment. Always retried — a step signing right after
      its own approve would otherwise race its own row.
    - "no settlement from ... is held" is the peer's evidence, which travels
      over the DCS-to-DCS channel after the peer's SUBMITTED. Retried only when
      await_settlement is on; scenarios that ASSERT the refusal pass False, and
      it is exactly this answer they mean.
    - "... settled document X, this instance settled Y" is two settlements that
      disagree, which no waiting resolves: PostSettlement refuses a divergent
      artifact at the door, so the stored pair cannot change on its own. Never
      retried — waiting on it would spend the whole window to report the same
      thing.

    A refused prepare persists nothing (the gate is checked before anything
    mutates), so retrying it costs one request.

    the contract's creator, and receivepdf.go records the ORIGIN peer as

    designated counterparty rather than from a local negotiator task.

    The change request is FREE TEXT on purpose. A structured redline is applied
    to contract_data immediately and re-shipped as a fresh PDF (negotiate.go),
    which would rewrite the document instance A has already signed — the very
    thing this scenario measures. Free text decodes into no ChangeRequest, so
    it is recorded for the negotiation audit trail and changes nothing.

    From NEGOTIATION on, the received copy is fully equipped for B's own
    workflow — receivepdf.go assigns B's peer DID to the reviewer, approver and
    negotiator tasks — so the tail is the same submit / submit / review /
    approve sequence instance A runs, and the one the two-instance Playwright
