"""Shared helper for infra-mutation test seams used by the "inject a
tampered/stripped artifact" BDD scenarios in contract_format_review,
c2pa_conformance (AC4), and real_signing_vertical (AC16).

Why this exists: several verify-shaped backend endpoints (GET
/pdf/verify/contract/{did}, POST /signature/validate, GET
/c2pa/manifest/{contract_did}) always re-fetch the SERVER'S OWN stored PDF
from IPFS by the CID cached in the `contracts.pdf_ipfs_cid` column (see
backend/internal/pdfgeneration/query/verifycontract.go and
backend/internal/signingmanagement/db/pg/contractrepository.go's
FetchContractPDFBytes) — there is no upload-a-PDF-and-verify-it endpoint.
IPFS is content-addressed, so an existing CID's bytes can never be
overwritten in place; the seam is instead:

  1. Add the tampered/stripped bytes as a NEW CID, via `ipfs add` exec'd
     inside the shared in-cluster IPFS pod (see _ipfs_exec_prefix below).
  2. Point `contracts.pdf_ipfs_cid` at that new CID, via the existing
     `context.db` test-DB connection (see environment.py and the
     `_seed_trusted_peer` precedent in
     steps/peer_trust/dcs_peer_trust_steps.py) — a direct Postgres
     connection is already an accepted test-only seam in this codebase,
     preferred here over a second kubectl-exec-into-postgres seam.

This is a genuine black-box test target afterwards: the verify/validate
endpoints under test do not know or care that the CID was swapped by a test
seam rather than by the application's own PDF generation/signing code path
— they just fetch whatever is at `pdf_ipfs_cid` (or the equivalent column
for other tables) and check it, exactly as in production.

Restoration: the original CID value is captured before the swap and
restored via `context.add_cleanup`, which behave guarantees runs after the
scenario ends (pass OR fail) — satisfying the "restore any cluster state
you mutate, even on failure" rule without a manual try/finally in every step
that uses this seam. The restore function is also returned directly so a
step can invoke it PROACTIVELY mid-scenario (e.g. "I fix the inconsistency"
in contract_format_review.feature) — calling it twice (once explicitly,
once again as the cleanup safety net) is a harmless no-op UPDATE.
